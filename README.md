Collection of Rewritten string.h Function Implementations

This project is a quick demonstration of my knowledge and understanding of some important programming concepts. The idea was to reinforce my understanding of pointers, ASCII, and I/O in the C programming language by rewriting the functions from the classic <b>string.h</b> library. Rewriting this library proved to be excellent exam preparation for "Introduction to Algorithms and Programming II", which formally introduced this library.
